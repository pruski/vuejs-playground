# vuejs-playground

#### Install and run
Add the api key in the `/src/app/utils/api.ts`, then 
`yarn && yarn serve`.

#### Notes
Following "This is not a test! Seriously, try and have fun with it, make it your own!" I decided to learn VueJS at this occasion. Using Typescript wasn't the best decision, as it is not documented enough for the given time frame (I did not know that when I was setting up the project). The code may be considered as over engineered, however I wanted to get a glimpse of how a large Vue app may look like. I must say I'm very pleased with the experience so far. 

Due to lack of time I had to take a couple of shortcuts:
- written only a handful of unit tests, just enough to demonstrate I'm trying to capture behaviour, not the implementation
- skipped image api, as it seemed straight-forward and I was interested more in wiring up filters with the list
- skipped comments, did my best to name things well instead
- did not break down components into smaller pieces (eg. movie details)
- did not clean up, so there may be a bit of repetition and hardcoded strings

Many thanks for your time

Konrad
